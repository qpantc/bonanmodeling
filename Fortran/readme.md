# Practical in fortran for the processes in Climate change and terrestrial ecosystem modeling

## 2. Quantitative description of ecosystems

Terestial biosphere models characterize ecosystems by features that control biogeochemical cycles and energy, massn and momentum fluxes with the atmosphere.
These include:

- Leaf area index and its vertical profile in the canopy
- leaf angle distribution
- the vertical profile of leaf mass and leaf nitrogen in the canopy
- the profile of roots in the soil
- the size structure of plants
- the distribution of carbon within an ecosystem


This chapter defines these decriptors of ecosystems

### Leaf area density

> Use beta distribution probability density function to calculate the leaf area density profile.
>
> - It calculate the profile for different values of $p$ and $q$ in the beta function (一种由正态分布演化来的函数) with $ \frac{L}{h_c}$

### Leaf angle distribution

> Uses the beta distribution to calculate leaf angle distribution.
>
> - It uses the mean and standard deviations for the five leaf angel distribution in table 2.1, and 
> - compares the numverical solution obtained with nine leaf angle classes ($10^\circ$) to the analytical solutions.
